# Analysing Strava data
> Simple script for analyzing the personal data that can be downloaded from the [Strava](https://www.strava.com) webpage

## Data aquisition

Data is retrived following this [steps](tobeadded). For now I use only the CSV file called ```activities.csv```. where there is general data about the activities but in the zip file that can be downloaded there is a lot more. The file is not added in this repo for obvious reasons.

### Comments

For now if some description has EOL in the middle it sees as a new row causing problems in the reading. Need to fix that so it's not needed to change it manually
