# Analysing Strava data
> Simple script for analyzing the personal data that can be downloaded from the [Strava](https://www.strava.com) webpage

## Data aquisition

Data is retrived following this [steps](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918437-Exporting-your-Data-and-Bulk-Export). For now I use only the CSV file called ```activities.csv```. where there is general data about the activities but in the zip file that can be downloaded there is a lot more. The file is not added in this repo for obvious reasons.

## USAGE
Just download your own data and change a bit the plots you want in the ```main.py``` file. Any suggestions to do in the future are welcome or even directly contributing.

## TODO
- [ ] Create CLI app
- [ ] Parse command: --year=*
- [ ] Parse command: --type=*
- [ ] Parse command: --file=*
- [ ] Parse command: --verbose or -v
- [ ] Create CLI menu using --menu
